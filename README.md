This is the highest form of programmable flattery. A cloning exercise that doesn't involve sheep, but does mimic the functionality of services such as Airbnb.

## With PadCrash you can, 
  * Create a user account
  * Search and reserve available pads
  * Chat with host for each reservation
  * Upload your own pad, and rent out to travelers
  * Endorse a host/traveler based on your experience


We believe in starting off on the right [â™«](https://gist.github.com/tmikeschu/4ccb96fbca3734d07a4e4a5e1c5e2ae5).
